This program is used to get the final state of a fifteens puzzle with a knight move, and also the sequences of how to get the final state.
There are five files within this program, including this README file and four java classes files. There are all in the src file folder.
Using any Java IDE such as Eclipse(where I wrote the code and tested successfully.) to run the program. (Run the main.java file.)
The program will be printing the number of the steps for every action of taking one state out of the fringe,
and also the size of the fringe, the the current board state which is being taken out from the fringe.
There will be the final state and the sequence in reverse-order printing in the end.
Runs pretty fast.
The heuristic.java file shows the heuristic function, which is adding all the knight_moves of all the numbers that are in the wrong place to get to the right place.
